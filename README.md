# MACHINE DATA CHALLENGE

<br>

## Script Summary 
- Reads in .csv machine data
- Cleans outliers from data
- Outputs statistics 
- Stores data in database, titled Machine data

<br> 

## Output Explanation 
- Outputs general statistics for "cleaned" data (as well as graphical representation)


<br> 

## Results Summary 
- We see that the "1" data had the most instances of machine failure, since the mean is very close to true 0 and the standard deviation is rather low
- Ultimately, all the data has very similar quartile readings, but min and max are all rather different. We see that readings from "0" and "3" likely have most moderate machine behavior, as they have very high max values, indicating a lot of noise. 

Overall, there are a lot of statements that can be made regarding the data, but with the information given, these are the two most important take aways.
